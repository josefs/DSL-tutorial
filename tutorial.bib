	abstract = {Kansas Lava is a functional hardware description language implemented
in Haskell. In the course of attempting to generate ever larger circuits,
we have found the need to effectively test and debug the internals of
Kansas Lava. This includes confirming both the simulated behavior of the
circuit and its hardware realization via generated VHDL. In
this paper we share our approach to this problem, and discuss
the results of these efforts.
